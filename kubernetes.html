			<h2>What is Kubernetes</h2>
			<p>
				KubernetesK is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a “platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts”. Above all, this lowers the cost of cloud computing expenses and simplifies operations and architecture. 

				It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes builds upon 15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.
